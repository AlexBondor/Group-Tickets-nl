		Hello there!
		<br>
		<br>
		As I promised the facebook notifications should work from now on!
		<br>
		You will get a notification every time one of the following happens:
		<br>
		- somebody joined a group you belong to
		- somebody left a group you belong to
		- somebody commented on a group you belong to
		- one of the groups you belong to is full
		<br>
		<br>
		When you click on the notification you will be redirected on a facebook page that contains my website. It should work the same as the website does. However if you get any errors let me know!
		<br>
		From now on the website won't change much because I've got other things to do as well.
		<br>
		<br>
		Coded with love,
		<br>
		Alex Bondor
