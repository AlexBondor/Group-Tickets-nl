		The number of tickets in a group should be displayed properly from now on!

		If you still belong to groups (that are created from now on) in which the number of tickets is not correct from now on please send an email to support@grouptickets.nl

		Hello there!
		<br>
		<br>
		As I promised the facebook notifications should work from now on!
		<br>
		You will get a notification every time one of the following happens:
		<br>
		- somebody joined a group you belong to
		<br>
		- somebody left a group you belong to
		<br>
		- somebody commented on a group you belong to
		<br>
		- one of the groups you belong to is full
		<br>
		<br>
		When you click on the notification you will be redirected on a facebook page that contains my website. It should work the same as the website does. However if you get any errors let me know!
		<br>
		<br>
		Coded with love,
		<br>
		Alex Bondor
